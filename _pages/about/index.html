I build end-to-end data projects in Python and R, from cleaning and organizing data to modeling, visualization, and write-ups that make results easy to use. I’m most interested in applied machine learning and data analysis, especially when it connects to real-world questions across different fields. Recently, I have been building a computer vision pipeline that detects, tracks, and identifies key data for basketball analytics.</p> <p>In my free time I enjoy trying playing basketball, trying new restaurants, and spreading positivity.</p> <p>I’m currently seeking research opportunities for Spring 2026, Summer 2026, and Fall 2026.</p> </body></html>
