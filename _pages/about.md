I'm Stephen Chen, a UNC-Chapel Hill student double majoring in Data Science and
Economics. I build end-to-end data projects in Python and R, from cleaning and
organizing data to modeling, visualization, and write-ups that make results easy
to use. I'm most interested in applied machine learning and data analysis,
especially when it connects to real-world questions across different fields.
Recently, I have been building a basketball analytics pipeline that uses
RF-DETR for player and ball detection, SAM2 for tracking across frames, SigLIP
embeddings with K-means for team grouping, and OCR models to read jersey
numbers.

I'm currently seeking research opportunities for Spring 2026, Summer 2026, and
Fall 2026.
