I'm Stephen Chen, a UNC-Chapel Hill student double majoring in Data Science and
Economics. I build end-to-end data projects in Python and R, from cleaning and
organizing data to modeling, visualization, and write-ups that make results easy
to use. I'm most interested in applied machine learning and data analysis,
especially when it connects to real-world questions across different fields.
Recently, I have been building a computer vision pipeline that detects, 
tracks, and identifies key data for basketball analytics.

In my free time I enjoy trying playing basketball, trying new restaurants, and
spreading positivity!
